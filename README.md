This is my personal portfolio website. I built it in order to documenting my knowledge in website development field. This website is build on top of Gatsby JS (React based framework).

I have made some basic tools to make life easier for users, one of which is a calculator. I just realized how a calculator works is very complicated. Not only about adding numbers or multiplying it, but also about telling the machines how the most efficient way to perform operations on numbers. It is cool, actually.

Currently, I am focusing on increasing data visualization content using D3JS so that the displayed data can be more dynamic and interactive. I intend to help many people in delivering data they have so they can reach more audiences.
